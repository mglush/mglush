# Welcome To My GitHub ðŸ‘‹
My name's Michael, and I'm a 22-year-old trading and computer enthusiast. This Spring, 2023, I will be finishing up my undergrad education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with Bachelors of Science degrees in Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science. I hope you enjoy looking through my current and past projects, academic achievements, hobbies, as well as anything else I thought could help you in getting to know me!

## Current Projects
1) [Open Quant Lab](https://github.com/open-quant-lab) - working with a small team to develop a cross-platform, interoperable open source trading platform where quants can implement and test their trading strategies on actual market data. Currently, the team is working on the general design of the lab, as well as starting to implement the public exchange API. Let me know if you would like to contribute to the project, we are always looking for more help!  
2) [MicroPython Data Aggregation](https://github.com/mglush/data-aggregation) - following my data aggregation project, I would like to rewrite it in MicroPython, so that I can  use it on a Raspberry Pi Pico micrprocessor to scrap the financial APIs on its own.  
3) [Market Analysis](https://github.com/mglush/market-analysis/) - my friend and I are trying to to break up an arbitrary instrument's price chart into a sequence of patterns, and use a stochastic approach to give a probability a pattern will appear in the given sequence of a patterns.

## Hobbies and Interests
- **Soccer** - I've played competitive soccer since I was a kid (2006-2019), and still follow a lot of the sport frequently. Started and coached a local soccer club for kids ages 4-10 while in high school.  
- **Philosophy** - ever since my roommate introduced me to several Heidegger readings my freshman year at UCSB, I've been avidly reading Aristotle, Aurelius, Hume, Kant, and more.  
- **Reading** - philosophy brought back my interest for reading, and helped me get into fiction literature again. Love reading anything from Mark Twain to Jack London to Stephen King to Toni Morrison.  
- **Chess** - I played against my father since I was young, but never actually took the time to learn any theory. When 2023 began, I started actively playing online chess and trying to improve my game. I am only a 900-rated player as of March 2023.  
- **Fishing** - both my grandpa and my dad love fishing, and that stayed with me; nothing beats waking up at 3-4 AM only to go out on the water and have the most peaceful couple hours of a lifetime.  
- **Skating** - my way to blow off steam and de-stress after a hard day's work. I started actively street skating my senior year of high school, in 2019, and have stayed with it since. It's helped me get through a lot of difficult/stressful moments in life.  
- **Teaching** - being one of my biggest passions, I've tutored high school IB Math, AP Computer Science, and AP Statistics. After briefly working in the industry, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a PhD degree in a field related to CS and Finance (although I have not been able to narrow my choices down to a handful of interests). My ultimate goal is to be a professor, instructing university-level students in a variety of disciplines, including algorithmic problem solving, automated market making, game theory, or perhaps cryptography.  

## Looking For
I am actively looking for work in the fields of backend software development or algorithmic quant trading. Please, do reach out to me about any opportunities you think I'm a good fit for!
