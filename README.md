# Welcome To My GitHub ðŸ‘‹
My name's Michael, and I'm a 22-year-old trading and computer enthusiast. This Spring, 2023, I will be finishing up my undergrad education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with Bachelors of Science degrees in Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science. I hope you enjoy looking through my current and past projects, my academic achievements, hobbies, as well as anything else I thought could help you in getting to know me!

## Other Hobbies and Interests
- **Soccer** - I've played competitive soccer since I was a kid (2006-2019), and still follow a lot of the sport frequently. Started and coached a local soccer club for kids ages 4-10 while in high school.  
- **Philosophy** - ever since my roommate introduced me to several Heidegger readings my freshman year at UCSB, I've been avidly reading Aristotle, Aurelius, Hume, Kant, and more.  
- **Reading** - philosophy brought back my interest for reading, and helped me get into fiction literature again. Love reading anything from Mark Twain to Jack London to Stephen King to Toni Morrison.  
- **Chess** - I played against my father since I was young, but never actually took the time to learn any theory. When 2023 began, I started actively playing online chess and trying to improve my game. I am only a 900-rated player as of March 2023.  
- **Fishing** - both my grandpa and my dad love fishing, and that stayed with me; nothing beats waking up at 3-4 AM only to go out on the water and have the most peaceful couple hours of a lifetime.  
- **Skating** - my way to blow off steam and de-stress after a hard day's work. I started actively street skating my senior year of high school, in 2019, and have stayed with it since. It's helped me get through a lot of difficult/stressful moments in life.  
- **Teaching** - being one of my biggest passions, I've tutored high school IB Math, AP Computer Science, and AP Statistics. After briefly working in the industry, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a PhD degree in a field related to CS and Finance (although I have not been able to narrow my choices down to a handful of interests). My ultimate goal is to be a professor, instructing university-level students in a variety of disciplines, including algorithmic problem solving, automated market making, game theory, or perhaps cryptography.  

## Looking For
I am actively looking for work in the fields of backend software development or algorithmic quant trading. Please, do reach out to me about any opportunities you think I'm a good fit for!
